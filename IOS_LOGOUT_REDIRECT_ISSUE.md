# iOS Logout Redirect Issue - Development Log

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: iOS users accessing the application through an iframe from a parent website are redirected to the application's home page instead of back to the parent website when they logout.

**Expected Behavior**: iOS users should be redirected back to the parent website they were redirected from.

**Current Status**: UNRESOLVED - Issue persists despite multiple implementation attempts.

---

## Technical Background

### The iOS iframe Problem
iOS devices have restrictions with cookies and localStorage in iframe contexts, requiring a workaround where:
1. iOS users in iframe are detected
2. They are redirected to the main application with tokens in URL parameters
3. Parent website URL should be preserved for logout redirect

### Current Implementation Flow
```
1. iOS user in iframe → redirected to main app with ?ios_token=xxx&parent_url=https://parent.com
2. Middleware detects parameters → stores parent URL in cookie → redirects to clean URL  
3. Dashboard pages detect parent URL → store in sessionStorage
4. User logs out → useAuth.logout() checks for stored parent URL → should redirect to parent
```

## Attempts Made

### Attempt 1: Basic Parent URL Storage (FAILED)
- **Date**: 2025-01-03
- **Changes**: Modified `app/page.tsx` to store parent URL from query params
- **Issue**: Parent URL only stored on login page, not available on dashboard pages where logout happens

### Attempt 2: Middleware Cookie Storage (FAILED)  
- **Date**: 2025-01-03
- **Changes**: 
  - Modified `middleware.ts` to store parent URL in cookie during URL cleanup
  - Enhanced `iframe-detection.ts` with cookie utilities
  - Updated `useAuth.tsx` logout logic to check cookies and sessionStorage
- **Issue**: Implementation complete but redirect still goes to app home page

### Attempt 3: Global Parent URL Detection (FAILED)
- **Date**: 2025-01-03  
- **Changes**:
  - Created `hooks/useIOSParentUrl.ts` for universal parent URL detection
  - Added `components/ios/IOSParentUrlDetector.tsx` for layout integration
  - Added `components/ios/IOSDebugInfo.tsx` for visual debugging
  - Integrated into customer and admin layouts
- **Issue**: Comprehensive solution implemented but logout redirect still fails

## Current Code State

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `client/middleware.ts` - Stores parent URL in cookie during cleanup
- ✅ `client/lib/utils/iframe-detection.ts` - Enhanced with cookie utilities
- ✅ `client/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Enhanced logout logic with iOS redirect
- ✅ `client/app/page.tsx` - Parent URL detection on login page  
- ✅ `client/hooks/useIOSParentUrl.ts` - Global parent URL detection hook
- ✅ `client/components/ios/IOSParentUrlDetector.tsx` - Layout integration component
- ✅ `client/components/ios/IOSDebugInfo.tsx` - Visual debugging component
- ✅ `client/app/customer/layout.tsx` - Integrated parent URL detection
- ✅ `client/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Integrated parent URL detection

### Logout Entry Points Verified:
- ✅ Customer Sidebar - Uses `useAuth.logout()` ✓
- ✅ Admin Sidebar - Uses `useAuth.logout()` ✓  
- ✅ Customer Profile Page - Uses `useAuth.logout()` ✓
- ✅ Admin Profile Page - Uses `useAuth.logout()` ✓

## Debugging Challenges

### No Console Access on Mobile
- Cannot use console.log for debugging on iOS devices
- Added visual debugging component showing parent URL status on screen
- Debug info only shows in development mode on iOS devices

### Storage Persistence Questions
- Parent URL stored in multiple places: cookie (middleware) + sessionStorage (components)
- Unclear if storage persists correctly across page navigations
- Need to verify if logout logic actually finds the stored parent URL

---

## Potential Root Causes (Unverified)

### 1. Storage Not Persisting
- Parent URL might be cleared before logout logic runs
- SessionStorage might not persist across page navigations on iOS
- Cookie might have wrong domain/path settings preventing access

### 2. Logout Logic Not Executing  
- useAuth.logout() might have bugs in iOS detection
- Parent URL retrieval logic might fail silently
- Redirect logic might be overridden somewhere

### 3. Middleware Issues
- Parent URL cookie might not be set correctly
- Cookie encoding/decoding issues
- SameSite/Secure settings might prevent cookie access on iOS

### 4. Timing Issues
- Race conditions between storage and retrieval
- Async operations not awaited properly
- Parent URL cleared before redirect logic executes

---

## Next Steps for Resolution

### Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Test Visual Debugging**
   - Deploy current code with visual debug component
   - Test on actual iOS device in iframe context
   - Verify if parent URL is actually being detected and stored

2. **Add More Granular Logging**
   - Add visual indicators at each step of the flow
   - Show storage status, retrieval status, redirect decision
   - Display all relevant values on screen for mobile debugging

3. **Verify Storage Mechanisms**
   - Test if cookies are actually accessible from client-side
   - Verify sessionStorage persistence across page navigations
   - Check if multiple storage locations are causing conflicts

4. **Test Each Flow Component**
   - Test middleware cookie setting in isolation
   - Test client-side cookie reading in isolation  
   - Test logout redirect logic in isolation
   - Test iOS detection accuracy

### Long-term Solutions to Consider:

1. **Alternative Storage Methods**
   - Use localStorage instead of sessionStorage
   - Store in URL hash/fragment that persists
   - Use server-side session storage with API calls

2. **Simplified Implementation**
   - Handle everything in middleware without client-side logic
   - Use HTTP headers instead of cookies
   - Implement redirect at server level

3. **Different Approach**
   - Use postMessage to communicate with parent iframe
   - Handle redirect at parent website level
   - Avoid storing parent URL entirely and use referrer detection

## Important Notes

- **Do not remove current implementation** - it represents significant investigation work
- **Visual debugging is key** - console access not available on mobile
- **Test on actual iOS devices** - Safari simulator may behave differently
- **Consider iOS version differences** - newer iOS may have different restrictions
