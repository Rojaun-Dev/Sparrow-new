### Key Features Implemented

#### Multi-Tenant Testing Architecture ✅
```typescript
// Example: Tenant isolation testing
describe('Multi-tenant isolation', () => {
  it('should enforce tenant isolation in getAllUsers', async () => {
    const companyAId = 'company-a';
    const companyBId = 'company-b';
    
    // Verify company A can only access its own data
    await service.getAllUsers(companyAId);
    expect(mockRepository.findAll).toHaveBeenCalledWith(companyAId);
    expect(mockRepository.findAll).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith(companyBId);
  });
});
```

#### Role-Based Access Control Testing ✅
```typescript
// Example: RBAC testing
describe('getUserById', () => {
  it('should prevent customer from accessing another user profile', async () => {
    const req = mockRequest({
      params: { id: 'other-user-id' },
      userRole: 'customer',
      userId: testUserId
    });
    
    await controller.getUserById(req, res, mockNext);
    
    expect(ApiResponse.forbidden).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      res, 
      'You can only access your own profile'
    );
  });
});
```

## 🚨 Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issues Identified in Phase 1

1. **Service Test Mismatch** ✅ **DOCUMENTED**
   - Some unit tests expect different method signatures than actual implementation
   - **Resolution:** Update tests to match actual service interfaces in Phase 2
   - **Impact:** Low - infrastructure is solid, tests need alignment

2. **Database Connection in Tests** ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - Initial database connection logs in test environment
   - **Resolution:** Environment variables properly configured for test isolation

3. **Coverage Baseline** ✅ **ESTABLISHED**
   - Starting baseline established for incremental improvement
   - **Next:** Implement systematic coverage improvement in Phase 2
